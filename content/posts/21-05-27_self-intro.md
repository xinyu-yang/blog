&emsp;&emsp;Hello, everyone. It is my great honor to have this opportunity to introduce myself, my name is 🐏💗🐟, I am a graduate student from xxx university, my major is cyberspace security. The aim of my major is to build a secure and reliable cyberspace.
As internet play a more and more important role in people's daily life, people upload more and more critical information in the internet, if the security can not be promised, people will suffer unaffordable loss. After three years learning, I think network security and privacy preserving is an interesting and meaningful thing, that is why i apply for this project. I hope I can do more useful research in the future.


&emsp;&emsp; I think the combination of work and rest is a long-term way. In my spare time, I like reading books, ranging from martial arts fiction to classic masterpieces. I also like doing sports, playing basketball, playing badminton, swimming and so on. I am a beginner in swimming and I am learning freestyle. I hope I can go further on the road of scientific research.
